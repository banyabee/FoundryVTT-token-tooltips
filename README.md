This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that adds tooltips for tokens for any system. Some, but not all, systems have some values pre-configured for the tooltip, but custom tooltip values can be configured for any system. The DnD5e system has the most built-in support, but other modules (including Pathfinder 1 and 2, D&D 3.5, and more) have some values configured to show out-of-the-box.

The tooltips for DnD5e include HP, AC, Movement Speeds, Passive Perception, Passive Investigation, Passive Insight, Resources, Spell Slots, Feat Usages, and Item Uses and Quantity. All values can be hidden if you do not want them to show.

Tooltips are shown for all tokens for GMs, and visibility is configurable for players.

For the custom tooltip values, the icon name is the name of the Font Awesome icon you want to show. You can search for icons [on the Font Awesome website](https://fontawesome.com/icons). Note that not all Font Awesome icons are available (FoundryVTT itself is in control over which icons are available, not this module - this module is just using the icons that are shipped with FoundryVTT).
